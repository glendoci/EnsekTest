# EnsekTest
No time for unit test

Used EntityFramework for first time

Had to stop UI progress do to lack of time and an issue with the SPA Proxy would of been faster to make an api and ui on two different solutions 

Created Upload for Customers/Accounts and MeterReadings

Changed the structure a bit, Account it's on it's own table and customer references to it for future design
